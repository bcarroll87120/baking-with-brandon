			<li>Samsung Galaxy Note9 phone and Acer Aspire E15 laptop running Windows 10</li>
			<li>Goals regarding use of website: to learn how to make cheap and healthy plant-based meals</li>
			<li>Frustrations: unable to find food or recipes that are cheap, healthy, and/or plant-based.
			Bill has started frequenting "vegan" food blogs and finds the recipes often difficult or containing
			way too many ingredients. Many of these recipes often call for unhealthy sugars, oils, and refined ingredients
				that don't promote the "whole food plant-based" diet that he wants to follow. He also gets annoyed by the
				multiple paragraphs that he has to scroll through just to get to each recipe.</li>
