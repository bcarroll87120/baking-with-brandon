		<h2>Persona</h2>
		<p>Bill Riker:</p>
		<img src="millenial2.jpg" alt="Bill">
		<ul>
			<li><strong>Age:</strong> 22</li>
			<li><strong>Job:</strong>s local food joint near his college campus. Bill is also a full-time college student</li>
			<li><strong>Technology: </strong>Samsung Galaxy Note9 phone and Acer Aspire E15 laptop running Windows 10</li>
			<li><strong>Behavior:</strong> Bill is overall outgoing. Has a moderate circle of friends and acquaintances that generally care about social issues. Bill has a particular fondness for animals and has a cat. He has gained a specific interest and concern for the environment, personal health, practices in food agriculture and factory farming, and how all of these topics relate to one another. Bill has begun watching and reading topics and articles about what’s considered a “whole food plant-based diet” that strictly relies on whole, unrefined plant foods. Bill has decided that he wants to adopt this lifestyle choice by cooking like-minded recipes.</li>
			<li><strong>Goal: </strong>Bill’s goal is to learn how to become proficient at cooking plant-based meals regularly that are cheap and easy to understand. He wants to fundamentally change his diet and eating habits one recipe at a time until he has mostly adopted a plant-based diet.</li>
			<li><strong>Frustrations: </strong>Bill’s frustrations include the inability to find pre-made meals or recipes that are cheap, healthy, and/or completely plant-based. Bill has started frequenting "vegan" food blogs and finds the recipes often difficult or containing too many ingredients. Many of these often call for ingredients that don't promote this lifestyle change that he wants to adopt. Many vegan restaurants or meals he buys are expensive, high in calories, and generally unhealthy He also gets annoyed by the multiple paragraphs that he has to scroll through on many food blogs just to get to each recipe.</li>
